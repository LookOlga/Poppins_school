                <p class="text blog-post__text">Terry O’Neill was a British photographer. He gained his reputation from documenting fashions, styles, and celebrities. During the swinging ’60s, in addition to photographing contemporary celebrities such as Judy Garland, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, he also photographed members of the British royal family and these iconic images have made Terry one of the world’s most popular and collectable photographers. 
                Terry O’Neill won many awards and last month was Appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to photography. Terry O’Neill sadly passed away on the 16th of November 2019 at the age of 81.
                As a mark of respect and to bring his work to our audience here we bring you a few of his fantastic photographs. 
                Would love to here your thoughts on the work of this remarkable photography in the comments below. </p>
