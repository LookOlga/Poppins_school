                        Remember when I said the Leica Mini was my first taste of Leica? Well, I finally upgraded to the
                        Leica
                        R7. An opportunity arose that I got a chance to have a Leica R7 on loan for a while with an
                        Elmarit-R
                        28mm f/2.8 lens. I have been daily shooting this set up for the last nine months and what I can
                        say its
                        been amazing. The months prior to that I was mainly shooting Point and Shoots like the Leica
                        Mini and
                        Contax TVS I. It was nice to get back to an SLR with all manual control and something a little
                        more
                        robust. I honestly don't think I have put this camera down since I've had it, and it has either
                        been in
                        my hand or bag every day.

                    <p class="text blog-post__text"> The R system was Leicas way of getting in the SLR game when a lot
                        of
                        professionals where choosing SLRs over the Leica M series so why not just make your own SLR
                        line, right?
                        The Leica R7 is part of Leica's SLR line up and this is the seventh iteration that came out
                        between
                        1992-1997 and was one of Leica's most advanced cameras ever. Now it wasn't the most advanced at
                        the time
                        considering it had no Autofocus, no auto-rewind or auto-advance, but that's the Leica way. The
                        Leica R7
                        dose has some automated features with Aperture priority, Shutter priority, and Program mode. The
                        maximum
                        shutter speed of the Leica is 1/2000th of a second with a low shutter speed of 4seconds and bulb
                        but the
                        only downside is the low sync speed of 1/100th of a second. On the other side of the top plate,
                        it has
                        an exposure compensation dial built in with the ISO dial that goes from +3 to -3 and the ISO is
                        is a
                        scale of 200-12800. with those dials came some safety features of them locking inlace so they
                        won't get
                        bumped by accident and the shutter speed dial is a bit stiff but smooth. Now the Leica R7 has
                        all the
                        standard SLR features from the depth-of-field preview and self-timer and tripod mount on the
                        baseplate.
                        The light meter of the camera is quite good and informative with .05 increments to help get the
                        precise
                        exposure. Speaking of exposure the meter in manual mode is a spot meter and in A, T or P it has
                        Full
                        Field Integral mode that is the equivalent of Nikon's Matrix metering mode. The meter displays
                        the mode
                        you are shooting in the bottom left corner, to the right of that is the aperture then the
                        shutter speed.
                        On the left side of the camera new, the lens is a button/switch that is a light that lights up
                        the
                        aperture in low light to make it easier to read. The camera is covered in plastic, which doesn't
                        really
                        seem Leica like but under each plastic, bob is metal which makes it feel really solid and tank
                        like.</p>

                        <p class="text blog-post__text">
                            The Leica R7 feels quite amazing in the hands it's an extremely solid camera that has some
                            heft to
                            it that makes it feel like a serious camera. The grip of the R7 is quite good, on the back
                            of the
                            film back is a protruding thumb rest that seems like it helps with the grip of the camera.
                            Then I
                            also use the film advance lever has a thumb rest as well because the camera is a bit heavy
                            and you
                            need the extra rest for your thumb. The shutter speed dial sticks out enough that this
                            perfect to
                            use with one hand finger without moving the camera from your eye. The viewfinder is pretty
                            bright
                            but not overly bright and its accurate of course since its an SLR. Honestly, it really
                            performs like
                            any other SLR camera.

                        <h2 class="blog-post__subtitle">The Not So Good</h2>
                        <p class="text blog-post__text">
                            Shooting a camera every day for a long period of time you really get to know the ins and
                            outs of the
                            camera and the minor annoyances that come with it. Now, none of these are deal breakers for
                            me, but
                            they are just really just fucking annoying but you get used to it. First of all this camera
                            is
                            fucking heavy, about 36.95oz with the 28mm on it compared to my F3 that is 33.40 with a 50mm
                            series
                            E lens mounted on it. Now, 3.55 doesn't sound like a lot but lugging this thing around for 6
                            hours
                            really takes a toll on your wrist but its a nice workout! Second, the fact that this camera
                            takes 4
                            LR44 batteries... It seems really excessive because most film SLRs take one or two tops but
                            in the
                            manual, it says it takes four batteries to prevent frequently changing batteries. With that
                            being
                            said the batteries lasted from November to just about a month ago when I was going out to
                            shoot and
                            the camera batteries died and rendered the camera's shutter to only operate on Bulb or 100.
                            Lastly,
                            the film advance lever is probably the least well- constructed part of the camera, it
                            doesn't feel
                            solid compared to the rest of the camera. I have only had the camera fail on me twice once
                            was with
                            the batteries dying and the other was when the advance leaver went limp when I was loading
                            the film
                            but I believe that was user error when I was loading the film in.

                            All images were taken with the Leica R7 and the 28mm Elmarit lens on it. For right now I
                            have only
                            shot black and white with this camera and when I finish the Cine Still 800T I will add those
                            images
                            to this! Sidenote: all shot by zone focusing. These images are from a recent trip to
