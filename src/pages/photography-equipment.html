                        <p class="text blog-post__text">As a beginner in photography, you need to learn properly from
                            the start. For this, you will need work in manual modes and have the ability to change
                            lenses as and when needed. A good camera for this is a DSLR or mirrorless camera.
                            This beginner’s DSLR comes with the EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 III Lens which has a range that
                            will get you great landscapes and portraits. It is capable of creating high-quality photos
                            and Full HD movies and offers partial and full manual photographic control. The 24 Megapixel

                            ability to use interchangeable lenses. You can also share your photos from your phone using
                            the camera’s Wi-Fi¹ with the Camera Connect app.</p>

                        <p class="text blog-post__text">The Fujifilm X-T200 is a great beginner camera. It’s new Face/
                            Eye Detection AF makes focusing on individuals or groups of people quick and easy. It can
                            achieve focus in dimly lit environments up to -2.0EV and get great image quality with low
                            noise. X-T200 is equipped with a vari-angle 3.5-inch/ 16:9 Aspect Ratio widescreen LCD
                            touchscreen that can be opened and closed between 0 to 180 degrees and rotated between -90
                            to +180 degrees. The Fujifilm X-T200 combines multiple videos with varied exposure settings
                            to increase dynamic range and make movies with more detail. X-T200 generates 4K (3840×2150)
                            video by recording 6K video with no crop (6032×3392). A gyroscopic sensor has been installed
                            into the camera body, this helps it determine how to account for camera shake and apply its
                            digital image stabilisation algorithm. </p>

                    <p class="text blog-post__text">These are all great cameras which will help you learn the craft
                        properly. However, my personal choice here would be the Canon as it is the cheapest and I find
                        it easier to use. This is just a personal choice though and Nikon or Fuji people will probably
                        tell you the opposite! </p>
