                    Want to create a best selling lens? Start with the highly popular, very useful 50mm focal length and
                    add
                    a relatively wide f/1.8 aperture. With the compact size, light weight, and low price that
                    combination
                    avails, these models tend to live at or near the top of best-seller lists. That is where you can
                    expect
                    to find the Canon RF 50mm F1.8 STM Lens.

                    <p class="text blog-post__text">
                        Sometimes, it is easy to justify the purchase of a lens for a subset of its attributes (such as
                        extreme sharpness). Still, when it is time to select the ideal lens for a particular use, the
                        focal
                        length always becomes a primary consideration. The focal length determines the angle of view,
                        which
                        determines the subject distance required for the desired framing, and the distance from the
                        subject
                        determines the perspective.
                        On a full-frame body, a 50mm focal length provides an angle of view that seems natural, and that
                        aspect brings great general-purpose usefulness. So useful, and thus, so popular, is this focal
                        length that 50mm (or very similar) focal length prime lenses are found in all major brand lens
                        lineups, with some having numerous options (Canon has six 50mm prime lenses at review time).
                        Fifty mm lenses are frequently used for fashion, portraiture, weddings, documentary, street,
                        lifestyle, sports, architecture, landscape, commercial, around-the-home, and general studio
                        photography applications, including product photography. As you likely noted, a number of good
                        applications for this lens include people as subjects. While a 50mm lens used (on a full-frame
                        body)
                        has a modestly too wide angle of view for tightly framed headshot portraits (a too-close
                        perspective
                        is required), but it is great for wider portrait framing.

                    <p class="text blog-post__text">
                        There are still no 50mm image-stabilized lenses in Canon's RF lens lineup. With the wide
                        aperture,
                        this lens has less need for image stabilization. Image stabilization has costs, including size,
                        weight, and price. In addition, Canon's latest R-series cameras feature IBIS (In Body Image
                        Stabilization) with up to 7 stops of shake correction, significantly improving handheld image
                        sharpness when the exposure durations begin to lengthen.

                    <h2 class="blog-post__subtitle">Image Quality</h2>
                    <p class="text blog-post__text">
                        Most 50mm prime lenses (the Canon RF 50mm f/1.2 L USM Lens outstanding) are not so sharp at
                        their
                        widest aperture setting. Would the second RF 50mm lens also break the mold?
                        In the center of the frame, with a wide-open aperture, the RF 50 f/1.8 is slightly soft. If this
                        lens was priced at $2,000, I would be disappointed. At this price point, expectations are met or
                        perhaps even exceeded slightly. F/1.8 imagery is quite usable, especially with some mild
                        additional
                        contrast and sharpening applied. By f/2.8, center of the frame results are quite sharp.
                        Image quality typically degrades as the image circle's radius is traversed, meaning that corners
                        are
                        seldom rendered as crisply as the center of the frame. That is the scenario we find here. The
                        corners are very blurry at f/1.8. Very slow improvement is seen as the aperture is narrowed,
                        with
                        reasonably sharp corners being rendered at f/11.
                        The following is a series of center-of-the-frame 100% resolution crop examples. These images
                        were
                        captured using an ultra-high resolution Canon EOS R5 with RAW files processed in Canon's Digital
                        Photo Professional (DPP). Note that images from most cameras require some level of sharpening,
                        but
                        too-high sharpness settings are destructive to image details and hide the deficiencies of a
                        lens.
